CubeRealm.io is a multiplayer sandbox game that can be played on any browser. CubeRealm.io allows players to build, explore, and interact with each other in various in-game worlds. Since it is a browser game, the player does not need to download or install anything in order to play!

The following info is from the cuberealm io wiki on info important to the application. 
Features
Building and Crafting: Players gather resources and materials to craft tools, build structures, and create various items.

Mining: Players dig through the world to uncover valuable ores such as coal, iron, and other minerals, which are essential for crafting and building.

Combat: Players can engage in combat with various in-game threats, defending themselves and their creations from hostile players.

Farming: Players can farm and grow food, which they can use to restore health.

Exploration: Every world is composed of multiple layers that players can explore. Below the surface, players can find Hell. Above the surface, in the sky, players can reach the Skylands, a mystical region of floating islands. Above the Skylands are the Asteroids, a layer with lower gravity, providing a unique exploration experience and challenging environments.

Armor refers to items with durability that provide players with some amount of protection from most types of damage. These include helmets, chestplates, leggings, and boots, all of which can be placed in designated slots in a player's backpack.

Armor Tiers and Durability
Armor comes in 8 tiers. Higher tier armor has more durability and more armor points, which reduces more damage. For example, diamond armor is more effective at reducing damage than stone armor.

Each armor piece also has a "base durability" value, which causes different armor pieces to have different amounts of durability within the same armor tier.

Base Durability
Armor Piece	Base
Durability
Helmet:	7
Chestplate:	10
Leggings:	9
Boots:	8
Each armor tier has a multiplicative effect with the base durability to end up with the final durability.

Protection
Armor is used to absorb damage depending on armor points. Each armor point reduces ~0.73% of incoming damage. A full set of armor requires 26 for each type of material, and Inferno Armor also requires the equivalent Diamond Armor to be crafted.

Trivia
Out of all of the armor tiers, wood is the only type of armor that can be dyed using a dye station.
Since a full set of Inferno Armor has 110 armor points and a damage reduction of ~80.3%, punching a player wearing the full set without any tools will only deal 1 point of damage (1⁄10 of a heart).

Damage represents injury from attacks or natural causes.

Health
Players have 100 health points, and each heart represents 10 health points. When their health reaches zero, they die.

Dealing Damage
Damage from attacks or natural causes subtracts from a player's current health. Players can also recover health from eating food.

Player Damage
Players can deal damage and knockback by attacking. Attacking without any tool (or with items not intended for attacking) does 5 damage, but certain tools do more.

Tool	Attack

Bow	[TBD]	~3.43*	6–30	7–33	8–36	8–39	9–41	9–43	9–45	10–47
Notes
*Knockback dealt represents when the arrow hits perpendicular to the player's hitbox.
For bows, the smallest number is calculated from the least time charging. The largest number is calculated from a full charge.
Natural Damage
Players can take damage from several other sources.

Fall Damage
This section is a stub. You can help the Cuberealm.io Wiki by expanding it.
Players receive 5 damage when falling 8 blocks (in all layers except for the asteroids). Fall damage increases when falling at greater heights, and this cannot be reduced with armor.
See also: falling

Lava Damage
Players receive 20 damage from lava if the player's hitbox is inside the lava block. This can be reduced by wearing armor.

Cacti Damage
Players receive 20 damage from a cactus block if the player's hitbox touches the cactus block. This can be reduced by wearing armor.

Reducing Damage
Main Article: Armor
Armor reduces damage from most sources, but at the cost of its durability.

Trivia
Attacking a player will briefly display the damage dealt as a number next to the injured player.
Damage indicators can show up through other blocks.
Tools of the same type share the same knockback values, even between different materials.
For the most part, damage appears to increase linearly with better tool tiers.
Bow damage varies based on the amount of time is spent charging. Charging for more time will result in more damage dealt.

In the game, when there are no blocks below you, you fall (duh). In all layers except for space, the terminal velocity is 80m/s, only being approached through very long falls, such as from the top of skylands to somewhat far down in hell. In space, the terminal velocity is only 7.2m/s, allowing the player to jump higher and to not take fall damage.

	Items are anything the player can use that isn't a block. This consists of tools, food, plants, minerals and ingots, and many others.

Items can be used to deal damage or mine blocks with the Left Mouse Button or hold by default, and they can be used (if it's a tool with a special ability) or placed (like flowers) on blocks with the Right Mouse Button or tap by default. Items can be dropped with the Q key or hold your inventory by default, and can be picked up again by standing near them, where they will then pop into an available inventory slot if you have one.

When dropped, an item's 3D texture will continuously rotate 360° while vertically bobbing until it either despawns or is picked up by a player. Items will despawn if left dropped for 5 minutes or longer. This timer applies even if the items are in unloaded chunks.

Tools
Main Article: Tool
Tools can be crafted by the player or found in dungeons. They each serve a unique purpose, which the player can utilize for resource gathering, farming, fishing, and combat. The tools currently included in the game are: Pickaxes, Swords, Bows, Axes, Shovels, Hoes, Hammers, Shears, and the Fishing Rod.

Tools have varying degrees of durability, block breaking speed, and damage depending on their purpose and the material they are made from. In order from lowest tier (worst material) to highest tier (best material), these materials are: Wood, Stone, Copper, Iron, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Infernium.

Armor
Main Article:Armor
Armor can be crafted by the player or found in dungeons. All forms of armor serve to reduce the amount of incoming damage to a player, which is represented in-game through armor points.

Armor can have varying degrees of durability and damage reduction depending on the armor piece and the material it is made from. In order from lowest tier (worst material) to highest tier (best material), these materials are: Wood, Stone, Copper, Iron, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, and Infernium.

CubeRealm.io's world is made up of 7 layers.

Sky colors
The sky changes color as the player travels between different layers of the world. The sky is not always visisble in the stone, deepstone, and bedrock layers, but it is still there, and can be seen in very large caves and tunnels.

The sky color simply depends on the players y coordinate (or y-level), and is calculated an interpolation between 2 colors chosen from a table.

Values	Red Green Blue	Colorbox and Hex	Y level	X Level
Value	Red	Green	Blue	Hex	Colorbox	Min y	Max y
7214621	110	22	29	#6E161D	 	-Inf	-310
1973790	30	30	30	#1E1E1E	 	-290	-160
3947580	60	60	60	#3C3C3C	 	-140	-10
5921370	90	90	90	#5A5A5A	 	10	60
6728959	102	172	255	#66ACFF	 	70	280
12894463	196	192	255	#C4C0FF	 	300	700
2629160	40	30	40	#281E28	 	720	Inf
When the player is between the minimum and maximum y levels for a given color, the sky's color is simply that color. If the player is between the maximuum y level of one color and the mimum y level of the next, the sky color is set to an interpolation between those 2 colors. This causes the sky to gradually change color as the player climbs or falls, rather than instantly changing.

The general formula, with the 1st color being C1, the 2nd color being C2, the max y level of the 1st color being a2, the minimum y level of the 2nd color being b1, the player's y level being y, and the sky color being S is:

S = C1 + (C2 - C1) * (y - b1) / (a2 - b1)
The general pseudo code to find the color, with C being the list of colors above, a being the list of the minimum y levels above, and b being the list of maximum y levels above, is:

set i = 1
while (i < number of colors):
if (b[i] >= y): break loop
i = i + 1
end while
if (a[i] <= y): S = C[i]
else: S = C[i-1] + (C[i] - C[i-1]) * (y - b[i-1]) / (a[i] - b[i-1])
This only works if the lists are 0-indexed. This means that the 1st item of the list should be accessed with [0].
Also, you might have to separate the color into 3 color channels, but the formula would look the same for each color channel. You can reuse the same i value for all 3 color channels.
Asteroids
Asteroids



The Asteroids layer is between y-level ~1100 and ~700 (though it technically extends upward forever, materials only generate in this range). This layer has low gravity, and contains 2 blocks.

Between y-level ~1050 and ~950 there are larger asteroids.

Although each fish has different odds of being fished up, each fish will always heal 1.5 hearts regardless of the type.

Smelting is the process of obtaining refined material from raw materials through the use of a furnace.

Mechanics
The item to be smelted is put into the input slot of a furnace and fuel is put into the furnace's fuel slot. The furnace can only start smelting once a valid item and fuel is placed into the corresponding spots. The furnace can't smelt invalid materials or if there is no fuel in the furnace's fuel slot. Once smelting starts, 1 fuel item is consumed until its burn time expires. After some time, the material will be smelted down and accumulate in the furnace's output slot to be picked up later.

Different items can have different smelting times or different fuel burning times. Although new fuel will not be consumed when nothing is placed in the input slot, fuel that has already started burning will continue to burn even if there are no more items to be smelted. If fuel runs out prematurely before an item is completely smelted, smelting time is saved until new fuel is added or the item being smelted is taken out of the input slot.

Notes
**Fuels burn for 1 frame less than the listed time above (denoted with <).
Ex: Smelting something that takes 5 seconds (Cobblestone) with a fuel that burns for <5 seconds (any Wood) will leave the item 1 frame from being fully smelted.
†The fuel is not or may not be completely made of wood.
Trivia
A player can sometimes use their fuel more efficiently by first placing a single "cheap fuel" (such as Wood or a Wood Slab) before the primary fuel, because the "cheap fuel" will put the smelting process ahead and prevent the last item from only having 1 frame left on it.
Wooden ladders end up having the best "seconds per log" ratio due to their long burn time relative to the 3 wood required to craft them.
Blocks of Coal have the longest burn time of any fuel (9 minutes), but do not surpass the burn time of the sum of its parts (1 minute per Coal).
For smaller smelting jobs, Blocks of Coal should generally be avoided in favor of simply Coal or other fuels.
Blocks of Coal can smelt more items than can fit into the furnace output slot, which can waste fuel (but only for items which take 5 seconds to smelt, such as Cobblestone).
A single Block of Coal can smelt almost 27 Inferium Ores into Inferium Ingots
The durability of wooden tools does not affect the burn time.
All wooden tools, including Wooden Bows, share the same burn time.
Other functional blocks or items that are not listed above cannot be used as fuel, even if they are made of wood.
As such, Workbenches, Dye Stations, Wooden Chests, and Wooden Armor cannot be used as fuel.
Trying to place anything that is not a fuel into the fuel slot will not work.
However, placing an invalid item into the input slot is allowed.
Ores that are not meant to be obtainable in survival (but can be in creative) cannot be smelted.

Ores and dungeons a similar Page than ores.

Ores are blocks found that generate in patches in various types of stone.

Most ores generate underground and can easily be found in caves. Each ore only generates at certain Y levels (i.e. altitudes). Ore is generated one time, by replacing its stone type when the chunk containing the ore is generated.

Every ore has a corresponding mineral. Some ores drop their minerals when broken, while others drop as ore blocks. Some minerals can be used to craft equipment, such as armor and tools. Ores are found in 6 of the worlds 7 layers; there are no ores in the asteroid layer.

Ores that drop in ore block form (rather than mineral form) must be smelted in a furnace first to obtain an ingot, which can then be used for crafting.

Copper ore

Coal

Coal is used to make coal blocks which are used as fuel for smelting or can be used raw for smelting.
Copper

Copper ore is smelted before used to make Copper tools, armor, block, chests and shears.
Iron

Iron ore is smelted before used to make iron tools, blocks, armor, chests and buckets.
Gold

Gold ore is smelted before used to make gold tools, blocks and armor.
Platinum

Platinum ore is smelted before used to make platinum tools, blocks, and armor.
Diamond

Diamond ore drops diamonds that do not need to be smelted. It can be used to make diamond tools and armor.
Sapphire

Sapphire ore is used to make sapphire blocks.
Amethyst

Amethyst ore is used to make amethyst blocks.
Emerald

Emerald ore is used to make chunk protectors, which can protect a 32x32 block area. Other players cannot open or close chests, doors, trapdoors, build, or mine blocks in this area without permission.
Ruby

Ruby ore is used to make ruby blocks.
Infernium

Infernium ore is smelted before used to make Infernium tools, blocks, and armor. To make Infernium armor, you will need gold and diamond armor.
Realm Crystal

Realm crystal ore is used to make realm blocks and realm chests. Realm chests function similarly to ender chests. You can place your loot in a realm chest and nobody will be able to take it.
Realm crystals will probably have more uses in the future. A theory is that in the inventory, there are 4 slots for “rings”. Realm crystals could be used to craft these rings, along with sapphires, rubies, and amethysts. Each ring would have a different function such as extra speed or strength.
